# AlphaScan Application

> An example application that reads a QRCode from an Alpha Anywhere component or html page builder and loads the remote PhoneGap page

You MUST load the included Cordova folder into the executable directory of the Alpha Anywhere Application Server.
This overrides the Cordova/PhoneGap JavaScript files that are included with the current build of Alpha Anywhere and allows Alpha Anywhere to load the required updated 2.8.0 versions of Cordova/PhoneGap.
